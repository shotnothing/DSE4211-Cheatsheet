**Bitcoin (BTC)**.
*   **First Major Cryptocurrency**: Developed for decentralized transactions without a central authority.
*   **Addresses**:
    *   Unique identifiers within the blockchain network.
    *   Enable users to send and receive digital currency.
    *   Security relies on asymmetric cryptography.
    *   Formats: Compressed and Uncompressed.
*   **Transactions**:
    *   Use a transaction-based ledger.
    *   Each transaction allocates all funds from the sender's address.
    *   Verified by miners using public key and signature.
    *   Follow a pushdown stack model.
*   **Mining**:
    *   Process by which new blocks are added to the blockchain.
    *   Miners validate transactions by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
    *   Relies on Proof of Work (PoW).
    *   Miners collect unconfirmed transactions and organize them into a block.
    *   Miners find a nonce that, when hashed with the block data, produces a hash value below a certain target.
    *   Valid blocks are broadcasted to the network.
*   **Consensus**: Achieved through mining, ensuring agreement on the validity of transactions.
*   **Mining Rewards**:
    *   Miners receive newly minted BTC for each new block.
    *   Block reward halves every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years).
*   **Mining Difficulty**: Adjusted every 2,016 blocks (about two weeks) to maintain a 10-minute block time.
*   **Forks**:
    *   Soft Forks: Backward-compatible changes to the protocol. Example: SegWit.
    *   Hard Forks: Permanent splits in the blockchain. Examples: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.
*   **Limitations**: Centralization in mining and trading, concentrated BTC ownership, pseudonymity rather than full anonymity.
*   **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**: Bitcoin uses secp256k1.
    *   Secret Key: 256 bits.
    *   Public Key: 512 bits.
    *   Message to Sign: 256 bits.
    *   Signature: 512 bits in raw form.

**Ethereum (ETH)**.
*   **Decentralized Platform**: Extends Bitcoin’s capabilities by enabling Turing-complete smart contracts.
*   **Smart Contracts**:
    *   Enable stateful, Turing-complete scripts to create programmable applications.
    *   Allow parties to transact directly without intermediaries.
    *   Terms are automatically and impartially enforced if the code is bug-free.
    *   Secured by Ethereum miners.
*   **ETH as Fuel**: The native cryptocurrency is used to power smart contract execution.
*   **External Owned Accounts (EOA)**: Commonly used account type, consisting of a private and public key.
*   **Transactions**: Simplified due to the account model, maintaining a balance in user accounts.
*   **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Migrated from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in 2022.
*   **Drawbacks of Smart Contracts**: Require full collateralization, consume significant amounts of gas, immutability, susceptible to exploitation, cannot access external data without oracles.
*   **ERC20 and ERC721**: Mentioned as standards.
*   **Advantages**: Transactional efficiency, enhanced consensus mechanism, token development platform.
*    **Disadvantages**: Costly Transactions.

**Ripple (XRP)**.
*   **Payment Protocol**: Aims to revolutionize global money transfers.
*   **No Blockchain or Proof of Work**: Uses pre-minted XRP tokens and does not rely on blocks or proof-of-work for consensus.
*   **Unique Node List (UNL)**: Users select trusted validators from a provided list to follow consensus decisions.
*   **Main Features**:
    *   Money transfer protocol with XRP as its native currency.
    *   XRP is pre-mined.
    *   Uses validating nodes to maintain a consistent ledger.
    *   Consensus uses low-latency Byzantine agreement protocol.
*   **Ecosystem**: Consists of validating nodes, tracking nodes, and clients.
*   **Advantages**: Attracts banks for streamlining payments, aims to be a “neutral bridge currency”.
*   **Disadvantages**: Does not support smart contracts.
*   **SEC Allegations**: Ripple raised funds through the sale of XRP in unregistered securities offerings.
